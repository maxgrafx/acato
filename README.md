<strong>This repository contains 1 HTML page to showcase my HTML, SASS and JS skills.</strong>

<p>
The header is created by javascript, the content is being loaded from a json file.
The animations of the sliders and text is done with Greensock's Tweenlite and TimelineMax.
</p>
<p>
The 6 mock employees have a hover that shows their name and function. On touch devices the hover is removed and the content is visible at all times.
</p>
<p>
The form below the employees is a mock form, it doesn't go anywhere. While typing the input gives you feedback on it's validity. The Send button below the form is only enabled when all the inputs are valid.
